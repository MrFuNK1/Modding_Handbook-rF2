This is basically a backup of the old and, unfortunately, incomplete official
ISI rFactor modding tutorial. Only minor modifications or corrections of the
original contents were made for a better reading. Comments from the original
author remained in the text, additional notes were put into formatted note
boxes. The below introduction was part of the original tutorial.

Welcome to the official rFactor modding tutorial. Here you will find
in-depth explanations of new features available in rFactor. We have also
included explanations of selected older variables in the open-source files
which have been part of our older products, these are provided for new
commers to the modding scene and those who simply wish to further their
understanding. Welcome to the future of racesims...
