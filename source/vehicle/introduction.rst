Introduction
############

Racecar or racetrack, which was first? Sounds like the chicken-egg progblem, right?
Well, I believe we can be pretty sure that racecars were first. People started
driving cars and soon also starting comparing their performance. It was just a
question of time when first roads were build to allow for this and later transferred
into racetracks. Anyway, racecars were first and that's the reason why this handbook
does also have racecars, or better vehicles, as its first chapter.

In this first chapter you will find all information available and required to
mod vehicles for the game. It will cover the main sections physics, graphics,
and sounds. The below grid provides and overview and quick access to these
sections.
