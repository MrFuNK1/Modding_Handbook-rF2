rFactor2 Launch Options
#######################

.. sidebar:: References

  Launch options were taken from the "CLI.txt" file that can be found in the
  game directory ``\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\rFactor 2\\Support``.

**************
Setup in Steam
**************

Launch or command line options for rFactor2 are used to modify the operation
of the game and can be set directly in Steam:

#. Right click on the rFactor2 entry in your Steam Library.

#. Left click on "Properties".

   .. image:: ./../img/rF2_steam_rightclickmenu.jpg

#. In the "GENERAL" tab you will see a section labeled "LAUNCH OPTIONS". There
   you can add the command line options. Multiple options are separated by
   just a blank space.

**************************
Setup in Desktop Shortcuts
**************************

When using a desktop shortcut to start the Dev Mode as described
:ref:`above <startfromshortcut>`, you have to add the launch options to the
end of the "Patch To" line. Example:

  ``"[YOUR PATH TO STEAM LIBRARY]\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\rFactor 2
  \\Bin64\\rFactor2 Mod Mode.exe" +trace=5``

.. note::	Again, remember to replace ``[YOUR PATH TO STEAM LIBRARY]`` with the
  path of where your Steam Library is installed.
