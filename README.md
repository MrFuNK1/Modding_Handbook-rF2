# Modding Handbook - rF2

This is the repository of the "Modding Handbook - rF2" source.

# Requirements

The documentation is written in reStructuredText (RST) and generated using Spinx. To work on the source and compile the documentation on your own, you would need at least the following:

- To write documentation or edit RST files, you can use any text editor of your choice. Suggested are Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ and Atom https://atom.io/
- To compile the documentation from source, you need sphinx-doc https://www.sphinx-doc.org

# Packaging scripts

There are a couple of packaging scripts provided. These are very simple bash scripts, intended to work on a Ubuntu Linux OS. Maybe batch scripts for Windows will be added later.
